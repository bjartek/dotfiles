# dotfiles for @bjartek

Using yadm to manage my dotfiles. 

brew bundle  to install homebrew
mr to install git repos

Setup with
curl -L http://setup.bjartek.org | sudo bash

Note that these are my settings and decrypting the secret yadm keys require my gpg password so it probably will not work for you :)
