# The reason of creating this script is that Endpoint Security VPN installs it's own application firewall kext cpfw.kext
# which prevents for example PPTP connections from this computer, which is not appropriate if you need subj connection just
# from time to time
#
# Usage: ./checkpoint.sh
#
# The script checks if Enpoint Security VPN is running. If it is, then it shuts it down, if it is not, it fires it up.
# Or, make an Automator action and paste the script.
# You will need sudo power, of course
#
# To prevent Endpoint Security VPN from starting automatically whenever you restart your Mac, edit this file:
# `/Library/LaunchAgents/com.checkpoint.eps.gui.plist`
# And change the values of `RunAtLoad` and `KeepAlive` to `false`
